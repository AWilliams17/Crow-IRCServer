-Setting up crow.ini-
The following serves as a reference for the settings outlined in the crow.ini file.
I've tried to make the ini self documenting by making the setting names detailed,
but if you are confused about anything this will hopefully clear things up.


ServerSettings:
This section handles the primary details concerning the server itself.
    -Port: This is the port the server will listen on. Common IRC ports
    are 6667,6668,6669, and 7000, with 6697 being for SSL (not implemented).
    The default port of 6667 should suffice.

    -Interface: What network interface to bind to. 127.0.0.1 is localhost.
    To listen on all interfaces, use 0.0.0.

    -ServerName: The name communicated to the client on initial connection.

    -ServerDescription: Describes the server. At the moment it is only used
    in WHOIS replies.

    -ServerWelcome: The welcome message echoed to the client on initial connection.
    The client's nickname is appended to the end of it.

MaintenanceSettings:
This section handles details pertaining to automated maintenance in the server.
    -MaintenanceInterval: How much time in seconds to wait between maintenance
    method calls. Default value is 5 minutes, so every 5 minutes, the maintenance
    method will be called.

    -(Not Implemented)FlushInterval: How much time in minutes to wait before flushing current
    server details (current channels + their opers, owner, modes, and banlists) + the server's
    own banlist. The default value is 1 hour.

    -(Not Implemented)DeleteOldChannels: If set to 1 (default), channels which have been up for more than
    a week and have not had anyone in them will be deleted. If set to 0, this
    will not occur.

    -(Not Implemented)ChannelScanInterval: How many days to wait before running the old channel scan.
    If DeleteOldChannels is 0, this value is ignored. NOTE: If ChannelScanInterval
    is set to 0, the server will not allow you to proceed. Default value is 1.

UserSettings:
This section handles details pertaining to users connected to the server.
    -MaxLength: The max amount of characters a username can be.

    -MaxClients: How many clients a host can have connected at the same time.

    -Operators: A list of operator usernames and their associated passwords. Separate each
    username:password pair with a comma. Note, if a username is the same as a previous
    username, that previous username will have it's password value replaced by the subsequent
    username's associated password.


-NicknameSettings-
This section handles details pertaining to nicknames of users connected to the server.
    -MaxLength: The max amount of characters a nickname can be.
