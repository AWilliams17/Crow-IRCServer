# Twisted-IRC-server
This is an (incomplete) Python3 Twisted IRC server implementation.

A lot of commands are not implemented yet, and there is no customization,
but joining/creating IRC channels, private messaging users, changing your nick,
all work. Also becoming an operator works but it doesn't do anything at the moment.
Plus there's modes. Can't remove them yet. :P

The code is kind of a mess right now too.

This started as a fork of d34thh4ck3r's Twisted-IRC-server, but I went ahead
and rewrote it as what currently was written in the fork didn't really work
correctly.

This is the first time I've written a server with Twisted so I imagine
I may have done some things wrong.
