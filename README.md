# Twisted-IRC-server
This is an (incomplete) Python3 Twisted IRC server implementation.

A list of what is currently planned and finished/unfinished is in `TODO.md`
A list of planned custom commands which are finished/unfinished are in `COMMANDS.md`
For viewing information on the structure of the project, see `CONTRIBUTING.md`

This is the first time I've written a server with Twisted so I imagine
I may have done some things wrong.
